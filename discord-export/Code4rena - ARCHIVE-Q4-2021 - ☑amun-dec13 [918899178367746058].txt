[12/16/2021 11:45 PM] hemulin
Likely between your 8 to 10. The team is centered at CET and at that time there's a good overlap. One of the engineers will ping you if it works for you.

**🚨 CONTEST ALERT**

@🐺wardens The **Amun** contest is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

What's next: Amun's team will review the findings over the next couple of days, and then we'll pass them off to the judge. Keep an eye on #📢announcements for regular updates on how the contest is progressing through awarding 🤑🏆, judging 🧑‍⚖️ and reporting 📜. Feel free to ping an organizer if you have questions along the way!


[03/31/2022 5:41 AM] czar102
Is there any approximate time the report will come out?

Contest timeline
This is a high level overview of the C4 contest timeline. We have an increasingly detailed operational manual in Notion.


[03/31/2022 5:51 AM] czar102
Yes, I know, it is just extraordinary for a contest to take so long to handle the report. Awards were published more than 2 months ago.


[03/31/2022 4:18 PM] itsmetechjay
We apologize for the delay.  We are working with the sponsor to get the report finalized and published as soon as we can.

Incredible! It’s done!


[03/09/2023 9:25 AM] czar102
I wanted to apply to be a judge with this high severity finding, but couldn’t link it. And after months and months the rules changed and I no longer can apply for the judge role since I’m not kyc’d and I won’t get it. What a pity.
